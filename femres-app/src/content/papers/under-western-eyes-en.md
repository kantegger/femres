Chandra Talpade Mohanty's 1988 essay "Under Western Eyes" is a foundational text in postcolonial and Third World feminist theory. Published in *Feminist Review*, it offers a powerful critique of Western feminist scholarship that analyzes women in the Global South, arguing that such work often reproduces colonial power relations and discourses.

## The Problem of Western Feminist Representation

Mohanty identifies a fundamental problem in how Western feminist scholars represent Third World women:

- **Homogenization**: Treating diverse women across different cultures, economies, and political contexts as a single, uniform group
- **Victimization**: Consistently portraying Third World women as oppressed victims without agency or resistance
- **Othering**: Defining Third World women in opposition to an implied liberated Western woman

This approach, she argues, mirrors colonial discourses that justified imperial domination through claims of civilizing missions.

## Analytical Framework: The "Third World Woman"

Mohanty demonstrates how Western feminist texts construct an analytical category she calls the "Third World Woman" characterized by:

- **Sexual oppression**: Reduced to victims of male violence and patriarchal family structures
- **Economic dependency**: Portrayed as economically marginalized without recognition of their productive labor
- **Traditional constraint**: Depicted as bound by religious and cultural traditions that Western women have supposedly transcended

This construction assumes a universal patriarchy while ignoring specific historical, cultural, and economic contexts.

## Critique of Methodological Approaches

The essay critiques several methodological problems in Western feminist scholarship:

**Universalist Assumptions**: Applying Western categories and experiences as universal frameworks without considering cultural specificity.

**Ahistorical Analysis**: Failing to account for the specific historical processesincluding colonialism, imperialism, and capitalist developmentthat shape women's experiences.

**Lack of Self-Reflexivity**: Western scholars failing to examine their own positionality and the power relations embedded in their research.

## Discursive Colonization

Mohanty argues that Western feminist scholarship engages in a form of "discursive colonization" by:

- Appropriating and redefining Third World women's struggles within Western theoretical frameworks
- Speaking for rather than with Third World women
- Reinforcing hierarchies between feminist scholars in different global locations

This process maintains epistemic inequality and undermines possibilities for genuine feminist solidarity.

## Case Studies in Problematic Scholarship

The essay analyzes specific examples from feminist literature, including:

- Studies of female circumcision that focus solely on victimization without understanding cultural contexts or women's own perspectives
- Research on veiling that interprets it only as oppression rather than recognizing its complex meanings and uses
- Economic analyses that ignore women's productive contributions and focus only on their marginalization

Each case demonstrates how Western frameworks can distort understanding of Third World women's realities.

## Toward Decolonized Feminist Practice

Mohanty calls for alternative approaches to feminist scholarship and solidarity:

**Contextual Analysis**: Understanding women's experiences within specific historical, cultural, and economic contexts rather than applying universal categories.

**Recognition of Agency**: Acknowledging Third World women's resistance, activism, and strategic choices rather than viewing them only as victims.

**Coalitional Politics**: Building feminist solidarity based on shared political goals and mutual respect rather than assumed sisterhood or similarity of experience.

**Self-Reflexive Methodology**: Western scholars examining their own positioning and the power relations involved in their research.

## Impact on Feminist Theory

The essay has profoundly influenced feminist scholarship by:

- Establishing the field of Third World feminist criticism
- Influencing the development of transnational feminist theory
- Contributing to critiques of white feminism and calls for more inclusive approaches
- Shaping methodological approaches in feminist research

It remains a crucial text for understanding power dynamics within feminist movements globally.

## Contemporary Relevance

Mohanty's critique continues to be relevant to:

- Contemporary debates about global feminism and women's rights
- Development studies and international women's programs
- Academic practices in women's and gender studies
- Ongoing discussions about representation and voice in feminist activism

The essay's insights inform current efforts to decolonize academic knowledge and build more equitable global feminist movements.

## Conclusion

"Under Western Eyes" fundamentally challenged Western feminist scholarship to examine its own complicity in colonial power relations. Mohanty's call for more contextual, self-reflexive, and coalitional approaches to feminist theory and practice continues to shape discussions about global feminism and the politics of knowledge production.
