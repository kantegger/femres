abstract: "This study, based on interviews with members of feminist clubs in New Zealand high schools, explores how they understand and negotiate celebrity feminism. The analysis shows that girls view celebrity feminism as a 'basic' but useful tool for defining their own and others' feminist subjectivity. While they critique celebrity feminism as 'trendy,' 'depoliticized,' and lacking intersectional values and political activism, they simultaneously acknowledge its potential value in drawing attention to feminism."

Sue Jackson's research paper "A Very Basic View of Feminism: Feminist Girls and Meanings of (Celebrity) Feminism" provides crucial insights into how contemporary young women navigate the complex landscape of fourth-wave feminism, particularly their relationship with celebrity-driven feminist discourse. Published in *Feminist Media Studies* in 2020, this study offers empirical evidence about generational differences in feminist engagement and the role of popular culture in feminist consciousness-raising.

## Research Methodology and Context

Jackson's study is grounded in qualitative interviews with members of feminist clubs in New Zealand high schools, providing a unique window into teenage girls' perspectives on contemporary feminism. This methodological choice is significant because it centers young women's voices—a demographic often discussed but less frequently consulted in academic feminist discourse.

The New Zealand context adds additional depth to the analysis, as the country's particular political and cultural landscape offers insights into how global feminist movements manifest in specific national contexts. The high school feminist clubs themselves represent an interesting phenomenon of youth feminist organizing that deserves academic attention.

## The "Basic" Nature of Celebrity Feminism

One of the study's key findings is that young women characterize celebrity feminism as "basic"—a term that carries both dismissive and practical connotations. This characterization reflects sophisticated analysis on the part of these young feminists, who can simultaneously recognize the limitations of celebrity feminism while appreciating its functional value.

The girls in Jackson's study demonstrate nuanced understanding of feminist theory and politics, critiquing celebrity feminism for:
- Lack of intersectional analysis
- Superficial engagement with complex issues
- Commercialization of feminist messages
- Absence of concrete political action

## Gateway Function of Celebrity Feminism

Despite their critiques, the research participants acknowledge celebrity feminism's important role as an entry point into broader feminist consciousness. This finding challenges academic dismissals of popular feminism and suggests a more complex relationship between different forms of feminist engagement.

The "gateway" function operates through several mechanisms:
- **Visibility**: Celebrity feminism makes feminist ideas visible in mainstream media
- **Accessibility**: Complex political concepts are presented in digestible formats
- **Relatability**: Young women can see themselves reflected in celebrity feminist narratives
- **Social Currency**: Feminist identification becomes socially acceptable and even trendy

## Intersectionality and Its Absence

The study reveals that young feminists are highly attuned to intersectional analysis and critical of celebrity feminism's frequent failure to address race, class, sexuality, and other identity factors. This finding suggests that contemporary feminist education—whether formal or informal—is successfully transmitting intersectional feminist theory to young people.

The participants' critique of celebrity feminism's limitations around intersectionality demonstrates sophisticated political analysis that challenges stereotypes about young women's political engagement and theoretical understanding.

## Negotiating Feminist Authenticity

Jackson's research illuminates how young women navigate questions of feminist authenticity—who counts as a "real" feminist and what constitutes legitimate feminist engagement. The study shows how teenage feminists use celebrity feminism as a foil to define their own more serious, politically engaged feminist identity.

This process of differentiation serves important identity formation functions while also creating hierarchies within feminist identification that may exclude some potential participants in feminist movements.

## Implications for Feminist Pedagogy

The study's findings have significant implications for feminist education and outreach:
- **Recognition of Starting Points**: Educators should acknowledge that different entry points into feminism serve important functions
- **Building on Popular Culture**: Rather than dismissing celebrity feminism, educators can use it as a starting point for deeper analysis
- **Intersectional Education**: The research confirms young people's hunger for intersectional feminist analysis
- **Respect for Youth Analysis**: Young feminists demonstrate sophisticated critical thinking that should be taken seriously

## Fourth Wave Feminism Characteristics

Jackson's research provides empirical evidence for characteristics often attributed to fourth-wave feminism:
- Digital and social media engagement
- Pop culture critique and analysis
- Intersectional awareness
- Skepticism of traditional feminist institutions
- Emphasis on accessibility and inclusion

## Critiques and Limitations

While Jackson's study provides valuable insights, it also has limitations:
- **Geographic Specificity**: New Zealand context may not translate globally
- **Class and Race**: The study could benefit from more explicit analysis of how race and class affect participants' perspectives
- **Longitudinal Questions**: The research doesn't track how these young women's perspectives evolve over time
- **Activist Bias**: Focusing on feminist club members may not capture broader youth perspectives

## Methodological Contributions

The study makes important methodological contributions to feminist research:
- **Youth-Centered Approach**: Centering young women's own analysis rather than adult interpretations
- **Qualitative Depth**: Using interviews to capture nuanced perspectives
- **Cultural Context**: Attending to specific national and cultural contexts
- **Intersectional Framework**: Applying intersectional analysis throughout the research design

## Contemporary Relevance

Published in 2020, Jackson's research captures a particular moment in feminist discourse while remaining relevant to ongoing debates about:
- The role of social media in feminist organizing
- Generational differences in feminist engagement
- The relationship between popular culture and political consciousness
- Youth political participation and analysis

## Future Research Directions

Jackson's work opens several avenues for future research:
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Tracking how young feminists' perspectives evolve
- **Cross-Cultural Analysis**: Comparing youth feminist perspectives across different national contexts
- **Digital Ethnography**: Examining how feminist identification plays out in online spaces
- **Intersectional Focus**: Centering young feminists of color and working-class feminists

## Conclusion

Sue Jackson's "A Very Basic View of Feminism" makes significant contributions to understanding contemporary feminism, youth political engagement, and the role of popular culture in political consciousness. The study challenges both adult dismissals of youth political analysis and academic dismissals of celebrity feminism.

The research demonstrates that young feminists are capable of sophisticated political analysis that should inform feminist theory and practice. Their ability to simultaneously critique and utilize celebrity feminism suggests a pragmatic approach to political engagement that older feminists might learn from.

Most importantly, Jackson's work reminds us that feminist movements are always intergenerational projects that require listening to and learning from emerging feminist voices. The "basic" feminism that celebrity culture provides may indeed serve as a foundation for more complex political engagement, suggesting that feminist educators and organizers should think strategically about how to build on popular feminist interest rather than dismissing it.

This study stands as an important contribution to understanding fourth-wave feminism and the ongoing evolution of feminist political consciousness in digital-age popular culture.
