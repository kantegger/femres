This article explores the diversity and complexity of contemporary feminism through a fictional "roundtable dialogue." Author Kate M. Ott invites six female friends with different backgrounds and perspectives, and through their conversation, demonstrates the multiple voices and ongoing tensions within the feminist movement.

## Key Viewpoints and Intellectual Confrontations

**Equality and Choice**: Participant B represents early feminist views, emphasizing the pursuit of "equality" with men through education and entering traditionally male occupations. L raises questions, asking whether women choosing traditional housewife roles means failure. This reflects women's struggle between pursuing personal choice and meeting group expectations.

**Race and Class Critique**: T (as a feminist) and M (representing Global South perspectives) offer sharp criticism of mainstream "white, First World" feminism. They point out that without considering race, poverty, and global inequality, feminism could become irrelevant or even inadvertently exacerbate oppression. M emphasizes that true feminism requires the privileged to "get less" and see differences clearly.

**Gender Identity and Queer Theory**: J represents a queer feminist perspective, proposing that gender is a "performance" and that "women" and "female bodies" should not be the only connecting threads of the movement. She calls on feminists to think about how the movement should proceed when gender is no longer binary.

**Religion and the Church**: Both the author and T explore from their respective faith backgrounds the role that churches and religion play in gender oppression, calling for advancement of gender justice within faith communities.

## Author's Summary and Prospects

As the initiator and summarizer of the dialogue, author Kate M. Ott acknowledges her privileges as a "white, American, educated, upper-class woman." She believes feminism should be a "justice-seeking praxis" that begins with women's real-life experiences but must transcend simple "equality" models. She emphasizes that future feminist movements should not try to eliminate gender, racial, and cultural differences, but should seek justice "because of our differences." This is an ongoing dialogue that requires everyone, including those with different opinions, to sit down, see each other, share, and listen.
