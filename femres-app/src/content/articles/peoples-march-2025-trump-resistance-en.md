## The 2025 Shift: From Women's March to People's March

On January 18, 2025, just two days before Donald Trump's second inauguration, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Washington D.C. But this time was different — what was once the "Women's March" has been rebranded as the "People's March," reflecting a fundamental shift in movement strategy and focus.

## The Numbers: 2017 vs 2025

### 2017 Women's March
- Washington D.C.: **440,000-500,000 people**
- Nationwide participation: **3.3-4.6 million**
- Global participation: Up to **5 million**
- Then the largest single-day protest in U.S. history

### 2025 People's March
- Washington D.C.: Organizers claim over **50,000** (some outlets reported falling short)
- Over **350 similar marches** nationwide in every state
- One attendee estimated: "There were 10, 20 times as many people the first time"

## Why the Rebrand?

### Broadening the Coalition

March organizers explained the rebrand to "People's March" aims to:
- Unite all people fearful of a second Trump Administration under one umbrella
- Include women, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and other marginalized communities
- Reflect priorities of a larger coalition of organizations

### Beyond Trump

Unlike 2017's focus primarily on Trump himself, the 2025 march targeted broader goals:
- Women's and reproductive rights
- LGBTQ rights
- Immigration justice
- Climate action
- Democracy protection

## Activist Exhaustion and Resilience

### Black Women's Perspectives

Multiple protesters and organizers spoke about feeling tired or knowing others who felt resigned. Black women particularly expressed frustration:

"Black women are exhausted by the reality that their commitment to pushing for progress on social issues is often met with a resounding rejection from the American electorate. Some are stepping back to prioritize rest and healing during the new Trump administration."

### From Marching to Legislating

Michigan State Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat, noted a key shift:

"When people ask if they should be concerned about a lack of groundswell of public action, I remind them that Trump's first election inspired a record number of women to run for office — and win — in 2018, including me. The impact of that endures. **We're not marching, we're legislating.**"

## 2025 Protest Symbols

### Abortion Rights Imagery

Protesters carried symbols of the abortion rights movement, including:
- Coat hanger posters (symbolizing unsafe illegal abortions)
- "My Body My Choice" signs
- References to extreme abortion bans in states like Texas

### Multi-Issue Unity

Signs and speeches covered:
- Democracy and voting rights
- Immigration justice
- Gender justice
- LGBTQ+ rights
- Climate action
- Economic inequality

## Evolution of Organizing Strategy

### 2017: Mass Mobilization
- Focus on creating historic turnout
- Viral social media organizing
- Spontaneous grassroots energy

### 2025: Sustained Action
- Focus on local organizing and sustained engagement
- Building cross-issue coalitions
- Long-term strategic planning
- Direct political engagement (running for office)

## The Nationwide Movement

### 350+ Marches

Marches in every state showed that despite smaller D.C. numbers, there's still widespread participation nationally. Local organizers took different approaches:

- **New York**: Focus on immigrant rights and sanctuary city protections
- **Texas**: Emphasis on reproductive rights and abortion access
- **California**: Climate justice and LGBTQ rights
- **Florida**: Education freedom and anti-censorship

## Youth Leadership

### New Generation of Activists

Unlike 2017, the 2025 march saw more young leaders:
- Gen Z organizers bringing new tactics
- Connecting climate justice to feminism
- Using TikTok and newer platforms for organizing
- Demanding more radical systemic change

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Internal Divisions

The movement has faced:
- Debates over priorities and tactics
- Questions about representation and leadership
- Balancing different communities' needs
- Maintaining momentum over time

### External Pressures

- Increased attacks from conservative media
- Legal restrictions on protests in some states
- Surveillance and security concerns
- Funding and resource challenges

## The Path Forward

### Immediate Actions

Organizers outlined key priorities for 2025-2026:
1. **Protect state-level rights**: Strengthen protections in progressive states
2. **Electoral organizing**: Prepare for 2026 midterm elections
3. **Legal challenges**: Mount lawsuits against restrictive policies
4. **Mutual aid networks**: Build community support systems
5. **International solidarity**: Connect with global feminist movements

### Long-term Vision

"This isn't about one day of protest, it's about building a movement that can sustain through 2028 and beyond." — People's March organizer

## Reasons for Hope

Despite smaller numbers, participants expressed optimism:

### Movement Maturity

- More sophisticated organizing structures
- Clearer policy demands
- Stronger cross-movement connections
- More elected officials from the movement

### Sustained Commitment

"We may be more tired, but we're also smarter. We know this is a marathon, not a sprint." — Long-time activist

## International Solidarity

### Global Connections

The 2025 march echoed international movements:
- Iran's "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests
- Latin America's Green Wave (abortion rights)
- European movements against far-right
- Asian democracy movements

## Technology and Organizing

### Digital Resistance

2025 organizing leverages:
- Encrypted communications for security
- Decentralized organizing models
- Digital security training
- Online direct action tactics

## Conclusion: The Evolution of Resistance

The shift from 2017's Women's March to 2025's People's March represents more than a name change — it reflects a fundamental evolution in American resistance movements.

### Key Transitions:
- **From reactive to strategic**: Long-term planning vs immediate response
- **From single-issue to intersectional**: Recognizing interconnected struggles
- **From protest to power**: Running for office and policy change
- **From national to local**: Grassroots organizing and state-level action

### The Enduring Spirit

While 2025's crowds may be smaller, the commitment remains strong. As one organizer said:

"2017 was about shock and anger. 2025 is about determination and strategy. We're not just resisting — we're building the future we want to see."

The movement's message is clear: resistance continues, just in evolved forms. From streets to statehouses, from protests to policies, the fight for rights, equality, and justice remains alive in Trump Era 2.0.

History will show whether this evolution from mass marches to sustained organizing proves more effective. But one thing is certain: the movement hasn't disappeared — it's adapting, learning, and preparing for the long fight ahead.
