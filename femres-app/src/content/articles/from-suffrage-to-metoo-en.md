### **From Suffrage Movements to #MeToo: The Enduring Global Fight for Gender Equality**

---

This article offers a sweeping overview of feminist history, emphasizing the enduring legacy of suffragists and the evolving tactics of feminist movements across four waves.

#### **Origins and First-Wave Feminism**

**Suffrage Movements**: The first wave began in the late 19th century, with global campaigns for women’s voting rights. New Zealand led the way in 1893, followed by Britain in 1918 and widespread enfranchisement by 1960.

**Suffragists vs. Suffragettes**: Suffragists pursued peaceful advocacy, while suffragettes employed radical tactics—including arson and public disruption—to demand political inclusion.

#### **Second-Wave Feminism**

**Post-WWII Mobilization**: Emerging in the 1960s, this wave focused on workplace rights, education, and reproductive freedom. Influenced by the Civil Rights Movement, it was shaped by works like *The Feminine Mystique*.

**Global Leadership**: Women like Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Indira Gandhi broke political barriers, signaling broader shifts in gender norms.

#### **Third-Wave Feminism**

**Intersectionality and Cultural Critique**: The 1990s brought attention to race, class, and sexual orientation. Feminist art collectives like the Guerrilla Girls challenged sexism and racism in cultural institutions.

**Legal and Social Advocacy**: High-profile cases like Anita Hill’s testimony spotlighted sexual harassment and the unique struggles of Black women.

#### **Fourth-Wave Feminism**

**Digital Activism**: Defined by online mobilization, this wave uses social media to amplify feminist discourse. The #MeToo movement exemplifies global solidarity against sexual violence.

**Global Reach**: Movements like the 2017 Women’s Marches united millions across continents, advocating for LGBTQ rights, racial justice, and reproductive freedom.

#### **Contemporary Challenges and Backlash**

**Declining Identification**: Despite broad support for gender equality, many young women in the West avoid the “feminist” label due to stigma and misconceptions.

**Persistent Inequality**: UN data shows that most gender equality targets are off track for 2030. Political representation remains low—only 16% of Japan’s parliament is female, and over 100 countries have never had a woman head of state.

**Feminism’s Future**: The article argues that feminism remains essential, especially in the Global South, where women face systemic barriers in education, employment, and bodily autonomy.
