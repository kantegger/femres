Pankaj Mishra unveils the deep crisis of global masculinity in this article. He points out that from Hindu nationalist Godse to leaders like Trump, Putin, and Duterte, modern political culture is saturated with a pathological pursuit of the "strong man" image. This masculine fantasy not only oppresses women but also traps men themselves.

## Core Arguments and Critical Dimensions

**The Politicization of Masculinity**: The article traces how, since the 19th century, industrialization and imperialism shaped the ideal of the "strong man" and bound it to nation, race, and power. This fantasy reached its peak in fascism and has been revived in contemporary right-wing populism.

**Global Expansion of Patriarchy**: Mishra points out that Western modernity established a global order through the division of gender and race, where women were excluded from political and economic power while men were forced to assume the "strong" role.

**Anti-feminism and Fear Psychology**: From Godse to Jordan Peterson, many male thinkers and political figures view feminism as a threat, attempting to restore lost privileges through "reshaping masculinity."

**Male Fragility and Suffering**: The author emphasizes that men are also victims of gender norms. They are more prone to alcoholism, suicide, and psychological trauma, yet cannot express vulnerability due to social expectations. This repression leads to violence, hatred, and political extremism.

**Cultural Representation and Body Politics**: The article analyzes how male body images from Hollywood to Bollywood have been politicized, becoming symbols of nationalism and male power. Muscles, violence, and sexual characteristics are used to mask social anxiety and identity crisis.

## Deconstructing Fantasy, Moving Toward Empathy

Mishra calls for us to abandon the fantasy of "masculinity" and face its historical origins and real consequences. He quotes Simone de Beauvoir's famous saying: "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman," and points out the same is true for men. Only by acknowledging male fragility and complexity can we truly break out of the cycle of gender oppression.
