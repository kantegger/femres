On March 11, 2024, at the 68th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women at UN Headquarters in New York, UN Secretary-General António Guterres delivered a shocking warning: "Patriarchy is far from vanquished; it is regaining ground." This was not diplomatic rhetoric, but a stark assessment of the global state of women's rights. From the Taliban's gender apartheid to America's abortion bans, from online hate to political exclusion, women are losing hard-won rights.

## Evidence of Global Rollback

### Alarming Statistics

The data Guterres presented paints a dark picture:

- **Every 10 minutes**, a woman is killed by an intimate partner or family member
- **Global poverty** increasingly has a "woman's face"
- **Maternal mortality** is rising in some regions
- **Child marriage** outpaces population growth
- **Women parliamentarians** comprise only **26.7%** of global legislators

At the current pace, achieving gender equality will take **300 years**.

### Afghanistan: Extreme Case of Gender Apartheid

Since the Taliban's return to power, over **50 decrees** have been issued to suppress women's and girls' rights:

- Banning girls from secondary and higher education
- Prohibiting women from working (with minimal exceptions)
- Forbidding women from traveling alone
- Banning women from parks and gyms
- Requiring head-to-toe covering
- Prohibiting women from appearing on television

Guterres called this "systematic gender apartheid," blatant oppression of half the population.

### United States: Democratic Backsliding

Even in the supposed beacon of democracy, women's rights are in sharp decline:

- **14 states** have implemented near-total abortion bans
- **28 states** have restricted abortion rights
- The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending 50 years of constitutional protection
- Transgender rights face unprecedented legislative attacks

### Global Trends

Patriarchal resurgence is not limited to specific regions:

**Europe**
- Poland and Hungary restricting abortion rights
- Anti-gender movements rising in multiple countries
- Far-right parties leveraging anti-feminist agendas for support

**Latin America**
- Nicaragua and El Salvador completely banning abortion
- Women imprisoned for miscarriages
- Femicide rates surging

**Asia**
- India's persistent high rates of sexual violence
- Japan and Korea's severe workplace gender discrimination
- China's increased "leftover women" discourse pressure

**Africa**
- Female genital cutting still prevalent
- Child marriage rates remaining high
- Conflict-related sexual violence increasing

## Autocrats and Populists' "Traditional Values" Agenda

### Weaponizing "Traditional Values"

Guterres specifically noted that autocrats and populists are promoting so-called "traditional values" to attack women's rights:

**Russia**
- Decriminalizing domestic violence
- Banning "LGBTQ+ propaganda"
- Promoting "traditional family values"

**Brazil**
- Bolsonaro attacking gender education
- Cutting women's health programs
- Denying gender violence

**Turkey**
- Withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention (preventing domestic violence)
- Restricting women's clothing choices
- Encouraging women to bear children rather than work

### Rise of Religious Fundamentalism

Fundamentalism across religions is attacking women's rights:

- Christian fundamentalism driving anti-abortion laws in the US
- Islamic fundamentalism restricting women's freedom in the Middle East
- Hindu nationalism attacking women's autonomy in India
- Buddhist extremism marginalizing women in Myanmar and Sri Lanka

## Digital Spaces as New Battlegrounds

### Proliferation of Online Hate

Digital technology has become patriarchy's new tool:

- **87%** of women experience online harassment
- Deepfake pornography targeting women politicians and activists
- Coordinated harassment campaigns silencing women's voices
- Algorithms amplifying sexist content

### Abuse of Surveillance Technology

- Period tracking app data used for prosecution
- Location tracking monitoring women seeking abortions
- Facial recognition enforcing dress codes
- Social media surveillance of feminist activists

## Deepening Economic Inequality

### COVID-19's Disproportionate Impact

The pandemic exacerbated gender inequality:

- Women's unemployment higher than men's
- Unpaid care work dramatically increased
- Domestic violence cases surged
- Girl's school dropout rates rose

### Labor Market Discrimination

- Global gender pay gap at **20%**
- Women overrepresented in informal economy
- Glass ceilings remain firmly in place
- Motherhood penalty pervasive

## Persistent Political Exclusion

### Underrepresentation

Despite progress, women remain marginalized in politics:

- Only **13 countries** have women heads of state
- **26.7%** of parliamentary seats held by women
- Even fewer women leaders in local government
- Women frequently excluded from peace negotiations

### Violence Against Women Politicians

- Surging online harassment and threats
- Physical attacks and assassination attempts
- Gendered smear campaigns
- Family members threatened

## Weaponization of Sexual Violence in Conflict

### Systematic Rape as War Tactic

Guterres emphasized that sexual violence is rising in global conflicts:

- Ukraine reporting Russian forces' sexual violence
- Mass rape in Ethiopia's Tigray conflict
- Myanmar military's sexual violence against Rohingya women
- Ongoing crises in Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo

### Culture of Impunity

- Perpetrators rarely prosecuted
- Victims stigmatized and marginalized
- Justice systems failing to deliver
- International community's inadequate response

## Rise of Resistance Movements

### Global Feminist Awakening

Despite setbacks, resistance movements are growing:

**Iran's "Woman, Life, Freedom" Movement**
- Challenging mandatory hijab
- Demanding regime change
- Inspiring global solidarity

**Latin America's Green Wave**
- Fighting for abortion legalization
- Opposing gender violence
- Building transnational coalitions

**#MeToo's Continuing Impact**
- Continuing to expose sexual violence
- Driving legal reforms
- Changing cultural norms

### Young Generation's Leadership

Gen Z and millennial women are leading change:

- Using social media to organize

- Creating new forms of resistance
- Building intersectional movements

## Conclusion: Fighting for Our Rights

Guterres' warning is clear: patriarchy is not dead, it's adapting, evolving, and fighting back. From the Taliban's extremism to America's abortion bans, from online harassment to political violence, the attacks on women's rights are real, coordinated, and dangerous.

But history tells us that every time patriarchy tries to reassert control, women fight back — and harder. Today's resistance movements, from Iran's streets to America's ballot boxes, from Latin America's Green Wave to Africa's #MeToo movements, show the unstoppable force of change.

As Guterres said: "Gender equality is not a favor to women. When women's rights flourish, the whole world benefits."

The fight is not over. In fact, it may have just begun. But one thing is certain: patriarchy may be regaining ground, but it faces the strongest, most united, most determined global feminist movement in history.

The future doesn't belong to those who want to push women back into the past. It belongs to those fighting for equality, justice, and freedom — for everyone.
