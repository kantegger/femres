## 2024: A Year of Feminist Resistance

In the second year after Roe v. Wade was overturned, 2024 became a defining year of feminist resistance and resilience. Ms. Magazine honors the year's bravest and most influential feminists and movements.

## The 27 Plaintiffs in Zurawski v. Texas

### The Lawsuit That Changed History

27 women sued the state of Texas, asking for the state to clarify "medical emergency" exceptions under its abortion ban. These women's stories shocked the nation:

- **Amanda Zurawski**: Denied an abortion when pregnancy complications threatened her life, nearly died from sepsis
- **Samantha Casiano**: Forced to carry a fetus that would not survive to term
- **25 other women**: Each with their own traumatic story, showing the cruel reality of extreme abortion bans

### Court Ruling and Impact

On May 31, 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled, refusing to clarify the exceptions to the state's abortion bans. Despite the legal defeat, these women's courage sparked national dialogue and action.

## Kamala Harris: Breaking Ceilings

As the first woman, first Black person, and first South Asian American Vice President, Harris continued pushing the gender equality agenda in 2024:

- Leading the White House Gender Policy Council
- Championing reproductive rights
- Advancing economic justice policies
- Serving as a role model for young women

## Black Women Voters: Democracy's Backbone

### The Power of Turnout

2024 data shows Black women continue to participate in democracy at the highest rates:
- **Voter turnout**: Over 70% in key elections
- **Organizing power**: Leading grassroots mobilization efforts
- **Policy impact**: Driving progressive agendas

### Challenges Faced

Despite this, Black women voters face systemic barriers:
- Voting restrictions
- Gerrymandering
- Polling place closures
- Voter ID laws

## Sarah McBride: Making History

### Policy Priorities:
- Healthcare access

## Abortion Providers and Funders: Frontline Heroes

### Providing Care at Risk

In an environment where 14 states ban abortion, providers face:
- Criminal prosecution threats

### The Role of Abortion Funds

Abortion funds provided critical support in 2024:
- Helped over **100,000** women access care
- Raised over **$50 million**
- Coordinated interstate travel
- Provided emotional support

## Jasmine Crockett: A Fearless Voice

Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett became a powerful advocate for racial and gender justice in Congress:

- Challenging racist rhetoric
- Advocating for voting rights
- Supporting reproductive justice
- Mentoring young women of color

## South Carolina's "Sister Senators"

South Carolina made history by electing a record number of women to the state Senate, dubbed the "Sister Senators":

### Their Achievements:

## Global Feminist Icons

### Iran's "Woman, Life, Freedom" Movement Continues

Despite harsh crackdowns, Iranian women continue to resist:

- Building underground networks

### Afghan Women's Resistance

Under Taliban rule, Afghan women risk their lives:
- Running secret schools
- Providing underground healthcare

## Lessons from 2024

### 1. The Power of Resilience

Facing unprecedented attacks, feminist movements showed extraordinary resilience. From courtrooms to streets, from ballot boxes to social media, women refused to be silenced.

### 2. Intersectionality Matters

2024's movements recognized that true progress requires addressing all forms of oppression — race, class, gender identity, disability, and more.

### 3. Global Solidarity

From Tehran to Texas, women recognized their struggles are interconnected. International solidarity became stronger than ever.

## The Path Forward

### Priorities for 2025:

1. **Protecting existing rights**: Preventing further rollbacks
2. **Expanding representation**: Electing more women to office
3. **Economic justice**: Addressing the gender pay gap
4. **Global solidarity**: Supporting women worldwide

## Call to Action

Ms. Magazine calls on readers to:

- **Vote**: Participate in every election
- **Organize**: Join or support feminist organizations
- **Donate**: Support abortion funds and women's rights groups
- **Speak out**: Share your story and amplify others' voices
- **Persist**: Never give up the fight for equality

## Conclusion: Hope and Determination

2024 was a year of challenges, but also one of extraordinary courage. From the women who sued Texas to the abortion providers risking everything to provide care, from barrier-breaking politicians to activists worldwide, this year's feminists proved the movement isn't just alive — it's thriving.

As Ms. Magazine has championed for 52 years, the future of feminism depends on all of us. The heroes of 2024 have lit the path. Now it's our turn to carry it forward.

"The feminist agenda is the human rights agenda." — This isn't just a slogan, but a battle cry for 2024 and beyond.
