In South Korea, the world's tenth-largest economy, gender inequality has long persisted, while anti-feminist sentiment has rapidly intensified in recent years. Through interviews with multiple young people and policy analysis, this article reveals the social psychology and political motivations behind this contradictory phenomenon.

## Core Issues and Social Tensions

**Conservative Government vs. Gender Policy Conflicts**: President Yoon Suk-yeol advocates for abolishing the "Ministry of Gender Equality and Family," arguing that gender discrimination is no longer a structural issue, sparking widespread controversy. The government plans to merge its functions into the Ministry of Health, but faces legislative resistance.

**Young Men's Backlash Psychology**: Korean men must perform military service in their twenties and generally believe women enjoy "advantages" in education and employment, generating hostility toward feminism. Surveys show that 60% of young men hold strong antipathy toward feminism.

**Politicization and Stigmatization of Feminism**: The Yoon government links feminism to low birth rates and false sexual assault allegations, further exacerbating social divisions. Some believe feminism "advocates female supremacy" and even "incites gender conflict."

**Structural Inequality Still Exists**: Despite women's high educational attainment, they comprise only 4.8% of Korean corporate executives and 19% of the National Assembly. Feminists point out that gender inequality remains profound and policy protection is indispensable.

## Social Reflection and Future Prospects

The article notes that despite rising anti-feminist sentiment, public attention to gender issues is also increasing. Former Gender Equality Minister Chung Hyun-back believes this debate has prompted society to re-examine the necessity of gender justice. Supporters emphasize that feminism should not be misunderstood as an attack on men, but as a protection mechanism for marginalized groups.
