Hosted by Cristen Conger, "Unladylike" is a podcast challenging traditional female imagery, focusing on how gender is constructed and manipulated within culture, politics, and algorithms. The show's "Where feminism meets fringe" motto captures its commitment to exploring marginalized aspects of gender identity often ignored by mainstream feminist discourse.

Through series like "Gender War Games," the podcast explores how white female identity is mobilized as a political tool, demonstrating how supposed feminist progress can be weaponized against broader liberation movements. Health industry analysis reveals how women's body standards are reshaped through wellness culture that masks control as empowerment. Anti-feminism's social media spread receives critical examination, tracking how algorithmic amplification serves patriarchal backlash.

The show excels at examining "non-traditional female identities" and their marginalization and commodification. Bisexual impostor syndrome analysis reveals how even within LGBTQ+ spaces, certain identities face erasure. Tall girl psychology explores how bodies that don't conform to feminine ideals navigate social expectations. Gun culture's gender dynamics demonstrate how Second Amendment discourse excludes women's safety concerns.

Contraception controversies receive nuanced treatment, connecting reproductive autonomy to broader patterns of bodily control. Cristen's approach combines rigorous research with accessible presentation, making complex gender theory understandable without sacrificing analytical depth.

Suitable for audiences interested in gender, power, media, and cultural intersection issues, particularly those seeking to understand how "non-traditional female identities" are marginalized and commodified. The podcast's critical language and deep research reveal feminism's complex position in contemporary society, refusing both uncritical celebration and cynical dismissal of feminist possibility.
