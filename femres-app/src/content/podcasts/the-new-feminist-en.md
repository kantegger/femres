"The New Feminist" is a podcast combining humor and critique hosted by Jill Sorensen, dedicated to exposing gender violence and patriarchal logic within cultural structures. The show takes a "common sense feminism" approach that makes complex feminist analysis accessible through practical wisdom and emotional honesty.

The pornography industry's sexualization of underage women and legal responses receive critical examination through interviews with Helen Taylor, Vice President of Exodus Cry, analyzing how commercial sexual exploitation operates through legal loopholes and cultural normalization. Interfaith women's solidarity and emotional politics of war features Heidi Basch-Harod and Nada Higuera discussing the "Daughters of Abraham" documentary, demonstrating how women across religious divides build peace movements.

Domestic violence survivors' artistic expression and cultural transformation features Shaynna Blaze, director of "The Fort," exploring how creative practice serves both healing and consciousness-raising. "Behind the Rage" series with Deeyah Khan provides perpetrator psychology and relationship violence structural analysis, refusing simplistic victim-perpetrator binaries while maintaining accountability focus.

Queer motherhood and Stoic philosophy's life wisdom features Karen Duffy, author of "Wise Up," demonstrating how ancient philosophy can inform contemporary feminist practice. The podcast consistently bridges emotional authenticity with structural analysis, validating feelings while demanding systemic change.

Jill's approach emphasizes how "common sense" often aligns with feminist analysis once patriarchal conditioning is examined. This accessibility strategy reaches audiences who might resist explicitly political feminism while delivering radical content.

Suitable for audiences interested in patriarchy critique, media representation, and anti-sexual violence issues, particularly communities interested in cultural critique, intimate relationships, and social action intersection. The show's frank, emotionally rich, and critically powerful style makes it an important component of contemporary feminist voices.
