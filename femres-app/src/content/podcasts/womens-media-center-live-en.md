"Women's Media Center Live" is an international feminist podcast hosted by Robin Morgan, dedicated to advancing global gender justice and cultural critique. As a veteran of Second Wave feminism, Robin brings historical depth and radical analysis to contemporary feminist discussions.

Violent pornography and gender politics critique features Gail Dines, author of "Pornland," examining how pornographic culture shapes sexual violence and gender relations. This analysis connects Second Wave anti-pornography feminism to contemporary digital exploitation concerns. Women immigrants and refugee experiences with Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, CEO of Global Refuge, explores how displacement and migration particularly impact women facing both gender and xenophobic violence.

Climate crisis receives feminist ecological perspective through interviews with climate scientist Twila Moon, demonstrating how environmental destruction disproportionately affects women globally while women lead frontline resistance movements. Media and political women's representation features Kathy Spillar, executive editor of "Ms. Magazine," analyzing how media systems perpetuate gender inequality while feminist media creates alternative narratives.

Feminist literature and writing practice with Sandra Cisneros explores how women's creative expression serves both personal liberation and collective consciousness-raising. These literary discussions demonstrate how cultural production remains central to feminist movement building.

Robin's approach bridges generational divides within feminism, connecting historical struggles to contemporary movements while maintaining radical critique of patriarchal structures. Her global perspective ensures discussions transcend American feminism's limitations.

Suitable for audiences interested in abortion rights, media critique, and political participation, particularly communities interested in transnational feminism, cultural critique, and social transformation. The show's profound, knowledge-dense, and historically grounded style makes it an important bridge between Second and Fourth Wave feminism.
