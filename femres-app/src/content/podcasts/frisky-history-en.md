"Hysteria & the Vibrator" analyzes the intersection of medical gender bias and body politics, revealing how supposedly scientific practices reinforced patriarchal control over women's bodies.

"Sex Ed Through the Decades" chronicles the evolution and controversies of American sex education policy, showing how sexual knowledge has been regulated as a form of social control. The podcast excels at connecting historical patterns to contemporary debates, making complex gender theory accessible through engaging storytelling.

The show's relaxed yet informative style serves as an important bridge between gender studies and popular culture, demonstrating how historical understanding can illuminate current feminist struggles and celebrations.
