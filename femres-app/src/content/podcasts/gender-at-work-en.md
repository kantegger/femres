"The Gender at Work Podcast" is a biweekly feminist podcast that invites global activists and thinkers to engage in cross-cultural dialogue around gender justice. The show exemplifies how feminist organizing transcends national boundaries while remaining grounded in local contexts and struggles.

The groundbreaking "What's Love Got to Do with It?" series positions love as the political foundation for organizing and resistance, challenging traditional separations between personal emotions and political action. Episode 28 provides critical examination of "feminist foreign policy," questioning how state feminism can co-opt genuine gender liberation movements.

"Gender Apartheid" analyzes the situations of women in Iran and Afghanistan through Episode 27, connecting local struggles to global patterns of patriarchal control. The "Femilemmas of Allyship" series addresses the complexities of male allyship and transnational feminism, exploring how solidarity can both support and undermine authentic feminist organizing.

Episode 29 traces emotional political inheritance from Audre Lorde to bell hooks, demonstrating how feminist theory travels across generations and geographical boundaries. The podcast consistently emphasizes decolonial perspectives and anti-militarization stances, questioning how Western feminism can avoid reproducing colonial patterns.

Suitable for audiences interested in global feminism, policy critique, and emotional politics. The show's profound, cross-cultural, and action-oriented style makes it an important platform connecting theory with practice, offering sophisticated analysis that honors diverse feminist perspectives while building bridges across difference. The podcast serves as a vital resource for understanding how local feminist struggles connect to broader patterns of liberation and resistance worldwide.
