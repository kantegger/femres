"Masala Podcast" is a South Asian feminist-centered podcast that emphasizes breaking cultural taboos and telling authentic stories. The show has achieved remarkable recognition, winning multiple awards and being featured prominently in international media, demonstrating the hunger for South Asian feminist voices in mainstream discourse.

"Tantra & Kamasutra: It's not about sex positions," recorded live at London Podcast Festival, explores ancient Indian spiritual practices and bodily sensual liberation, reclaiming these traditions from Western appropriation and commercialization. "Can I ask a man to fix my mice problem?" uses mouse infestation as metaphor for humorous dialogue about tensions between feminist independence and practical interdependence.

"Belonging & Identity: South Asians, where is home?" addresses the complexity of immigrant identity and belonging, exploring how diaspora experiences create unique forms of cultural navigation and feminist consciousness. "Feminism & Resting: South Asian women, let's reclaim rest" positions rest as feminist action, critiquing cultural norms of overwork and self-sacrifice particularly prevalent in South Asian communities.

"South Asian Motherhood: it's not for all women" challenges mandatory motherhood and reproductive pressure, sharing stories of infertility and childfree choice that counter cultural expectations. The conversation with "Never Have I Ever" actress Richa Moorjani explores South Asian women's representation and resistance in Western media, examining how visibility can both challenge and reinforce stereotypes.

The podcast consistently centers shame as a cultural mechanism of control, providing therapeutic space for listeners to process internalized oppression. Sangeeta's approach combines personal vulnerability with political analysis, demonstrating how individual healing connects to collective liberation.

Suitable for audiences interested in South Asian feminism, cultural critique, and body politics, particularly communities interested in shame, belonging, gender norms, and mental health issues. The show's intimate, profound, and healing style makes it an important voice platform for South Asian feminism, creating space for stories rarely heard in mainstream feminist discourse.
