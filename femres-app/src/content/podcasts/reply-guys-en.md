"Reply Guys" is a leftist feminist political podcast hosted by Kate and Julia, dedicated to exposing gender inequality and structural problems in American politics. The show's title reclaims the derogatory term for men who condescendingly respond to women online, turning it into a platform for feminist political commentary.

"Roe Is Dead, Now What?" provides critical analysis of abortion rights and Supreme Court decisions, moving beyond mourning to strategic organizing. The hosts connect reproductive justice to broader patterns of bodily autonomy and state control, offering both analysis and actionable resistance strategies.

"The Internet Is a Hellscape" examines online gender violence and media bias, analyzing how digital spaces reproduce and amplify misogyny while exploring strategies for feminist digital resistance. Their coverage of labor movements features interviews with Amazon union organizers, highlighting women's often-invisible leadership in worker struggles.

Progressive politics' gender tensions receive nuanced treatment through interviews with AOC supporters and critics, examining how even progressive movements can reproduce patriarchal patterns. "Running While Female" explores challenges facing women candidates, from appearance policing to competence questioning, demonstrating how electoral systems remain structurally hostile to women's participation.

The podcast excels at combining comedy with serious political analysis, making complex issues accessible without sacrificing depth. Their approach demonstrates how humor can be a tool for feminist resistance rather than trivializing women's struggles.

Suitable for audiences interested in abortion rights, political participation, and media representation critique, particularly communities interested in leftist politics and gender intersection issues. The show's sharp, humorous, and critical style makes it an important voice in progressive feminism, demonstrating how political comedy can serve feminist liberation rather than reinforcing oppressive structures.
