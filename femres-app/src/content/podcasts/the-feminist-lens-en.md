"The Feminist Lens" is a podcast hosted by Nina de Ayala Parker and Peris Thuo that examines British society through an explicitly feminist framework, connecting local struggles to broader patterns of gender justice.

The show addresses British abortion rights status and legal reform advocacy through interviews with Kerry Abel, chair of Abortion Rights UK, exploring how reproductive autonomy remains precarious even in supposedly progressive contexts. British racism and Black women's representation features Gloria Onitiri, founder of "Letter to a Black Girl," examining how intersectional oppression manifests in UK institutions.

Child poverty and educational justice receive attention through conversations with Carmel McConnell, founder of Magic Breakfast, demonstrating how gender intersects with economic inequality to impact children's opportunities. Sexual harassment and public space safety features Eliza Hatch, founder of Cheer Up Luv, documenting street harassment patterns and resistance strategies.

Feminist broadcasting and media discourse reshaping through Byline Radio collaboration demonstrates how alternative media can challenge mainstream narratives. Police violence, misogyny culture, and institutional oppression receive comprehensive treatment through Helen Pankhurst's special episode, connecting historical suffragette struggles to contemporary resistance.

The podcast consistently emphasizes how British feminism must address colonial legacies and racial dynamics while challenging class structures. Their approach centers marginalized voices within UK feminist movements, refusing to replicate white middle-class feminist limitations.

Suitable for audiences interested in abortion rights, anti-sexual violence, race and gender, political participation, and media representation critique, particularly communities interested in British feminist advocacy and public discourse. The show's direct, advocacy-strong style makes it an important platform for feminist media practice, demonstrating how local activism connects to global feminist movements.
