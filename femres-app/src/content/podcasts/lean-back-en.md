"Lean Back" is a critical feminist podcast hosted by Lisa Corrigan and Laura Weiderhaft that applies rigorous feminist analysis to contemporary American cultural and political phenomena. The show's title deliberately counters corporate feminism's "lean in" philosophy, advocating instead for structural critique over individual solutions.

Their abortion rights analysis frames reproductive autonomy as a structural freedom issue, connecting individual access to broader patterns of state control over women's bodies. The "Democracy" episode provides gendered analysis of American democratic institutional crisis, examining how patriarchal structures undermine genuine democratic participation.

"Perfectionism" explores how perfectionism functions as women's self-regulation mechanism, analyzing cultural roots of impossible standards imposed on women across professional and personal spheres. Their "Complicity" discussions examine how silence and participation in patriarchal systems create structural support for oppression, even among those who might identify as feminist.

"Candor" episodes focus on the political significance of women's frank expression and righteous anger, challenging cultural expectations that women remain polite and accommodating. Their "Sabotage" analysis connects socially destructive behavior to gendered power structures, exploring how systemic oppression manifests in various forms of resistance and reaction.

The podcast consistently applies feminist theoretical frameworks to current events, making complex cultural analysis accessible while maintaining intellectual rigor. Their approach demonstrates how seemingly individual experiences connect to broader structural patterns of oppression and resistance.

Suitable for audiences interested in radical feminism, abortion rights, political participation, cultural critique, and patriarchy critique, particularly communities interested in theory-driven feminist analysis and American social structures. The show's sharp, academically rigorous style makes it an important platform for feminist cultural political critique, bridging academic feminist theory with contemporary political analysis.
