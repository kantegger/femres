"Women on the Line" is an Australian feminist radio podcast co-produced by multiple hosts, dedicated to amplifying marginalized community voices. The show exemplifies how community radio can serve as a platform for radical feminist politics and international solidarity.

Palestinian decolonial movements and Arab-Jewish solidarity history feature interviews with Sadia Agsous-Bienstein and Tasnim Sammak, connecting Australian activism to global anti-colonial struggles. This internationalist approach demonstrates how local feminist movements must engage with global liberation movements.

Public housing demolition struggles and community organizing through "44 Flats United" reveals how gentrification disproportionately impacts women, particularly single mothers and elderly women dependent on public housing. Tech hegemony and digital privacy critique with Cher Tan and Lucinda Thorpe examines how surveillance capitalism particularly threatens women's autonomy and safety.

"Converge on Canberra – Sanction Israel Now!" documents direct action at Australia's Parliament, demonstrating how feminist movements increasingly recognize Palestine solidarity as gender justice issue. Permaculture practice and queer space building features Thaan, founder of Wholistik Permaculture, exploring how ecological practice intersects with gender liberation.

The podcast's multi-host format creates space for diverse perspectives within Australian feminism, particularly centering Indigenous, migrant, and working-class women's voices often marginalized in mainstream feminist discourse. Their community radio roots ensure accountability to grassroots movements rather than commercial interests.

Suitable for audiences interested in decolonial feminism, political participation, and capitalism critique, particularly communities interested in Global South perspectives, community action, and media resistance. The show's profound, cross-cultural, and action-oriented style makes it a core feminist voice in Australian progressive broadcasting.
