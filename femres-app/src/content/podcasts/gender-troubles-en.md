"Gender Troubles" is a podcast that examines feminist theory through a critical leftist lens, hosted by Emma and Eva. The show excels at making complex theoretical debates accessible while maintaining intellectual rigor and political engagement.

The podcast tackles pornography platformization and anti-sex work policy critique through interviews with Maggie MacDonald from Toronto Sex Work Action Project, analyzing how digital capitalism transforms sexual labor while examining policy responses that often harm rather than protect sex workers. Their exploration of "sex wars" revisits internal feminist debates over pornography and sexual politics through rereading canonical texts by Gayle Rubin, Andrea Dworkin, and Catharine MacKinnon.

Abortion rights receive comprehensive treatment through their response to the Roe v. Wade decision leak, providing both immediate political analysis and resource organization for listeners. Their collaboration with Pullback podcast discussing "Porn Work" examines ethical consumption and capitalist sexual labor critique, questioning how consumption choices relate to broader structural change.

The show's fall feminist reading lists feature cultural recommendations including Andrea Lawlor, Jenny Odell, and Michaela Coel, demonstrating how feminist theory intersects with contemporary cultural production. Their approach consistently emphasizes knowledge democratization, making academic feminist discourse accessible beyond university settings.

Suitable for audiences interested in radical feminism, capitalism critique, anti-sexual violence advocacy, and media representation critique, particularly communities interested in gender politics and academic discourse deconstruction. The show's theory-dense, critically sharp style makes it an important platform for feminist knowledge democratization, bridging academic feminist theory with broader political movements and cultural conversations.
