"She Who Persisted" is a cross-cultural feminist podcast co-hosted by an American and an Austrian, creating unique transnational dialogue around gender justice and political resistance. The show's title references both Hillary Clinton's famous "she persisted" moment and broader patterns of women's political resilience.

"#YesMyAriel" analyzes Black Ariel and Disney's racial controversies surrounding Halle Bailey's casting, examining how supposedly progressive representation becomes a battlefield for white supremacist backlash. The hosts connect this to broader patterns of racial gatekeeping in cultural production.

Their LGBTQ+ historical figure commemoration honors Marsha P. Johnson and Brenda Howard through oral history and pride movement contributions, preserving community memory often erased from mainstream narratives. This archival work demonstrates how feminist podcasting can serve as alternative historical documentation.

The abortion rights crisis receives transatlantic analysis, comparing American and European anti-abortion discourse emergence and policy developments. This comparative approach reveals how patriarchal movements coordinate across borders while adapting to local contexts.

Austrian political scandals receive feminist analysis through the "Ibiza video" incident, examining anti-corruption mechanisms through gender perspectives. Gaming culture's gender exclusion and marginalized community participation barriers feature Dr. Emma Vossen discussing "Feminism in Play," while tech industry sexism and labor organizing receive treatment through interviews with Dr. Mar Hicks, computing historian.

The podcast demonstrates how local struggles connect to global patterns while maintaining cultural specificity. Their bilingual, bicultural approach creates space for nuanced discussion often lost in single-nation feminist discourse.

Suitable for audiences interested in political participation, anti-sexual violence, media representation critique, oral history, and digital feminism, particularly communities interested in transnational feminism, community memory, and cultural critique. The show's critical, cross-cultural, and humorous style makes it an independent voice in feminist podcasting.
