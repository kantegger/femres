"Fifty Feminist States" is a travel and interview-based feminist podcast hosted by Amelia Hruby that documents feminist voices across America. Through a unique road trip format, the show captures diverse regional perspectives on feminist practice and community building.

The podcast explores critical themes including reproductive health as a social justice issue through interviews with Regina Townsend, founder of The Broken Brown Egg, examining how reproductive autonomy intersects with broader social justice movements. L'Oreal Thompson Payton hosts special episodes focusing on Black women's experiences with infertility, offering crucial narratives often absent from mainstream reproductive health discourse.

Mary L. Chang contributes discussions on cultural memory and identity reconstruction, exploring how belief systems and career paths transform through feminist consciousness. The show addresses media representation and accessibility through conversations with Angie Yglesias, examining how diversity and empowerment manifest in contemporary media landscapes.

Feminist writing serves as both creative expression and trauma recovery tool, with Mary L. Chang analyzing how music writing becomes a vehicle for empathy and healing. The podcast demonstrates how feminist practice varies across geographic regions while maintaining common threads of resistance and community building.

Suitable for audiences interested in intersectional feminism, reproductive autonomy, Black feminism, oral history, and cultural critique, particularly communities interested in American regional feminist practices and community experiences. The show's warm, geographically-grounded style makes it an important platform for feminist archiving and cultural transmission, preserving diverse voices in the contemporary feminist movement.
