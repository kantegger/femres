"Shrinks on Third" is a feminist psychology podcast hosted by two senior psychologists dedicated to combining mental health issues with social structural critique. The show refuses to separate individual psychological suffering from the political structures that create and maintain it.

"Adult ADHD" explores social functioning barriers, examining how ADHD diagnosis and treatment intersect with gender, as women's ADHD often goes unrecognized due to different symptom presentation and social expectations. "Sociopathy" addresses antisocial personality and psychological violence recognition, particularly important for women who are often socialized to excuse or minimize abusive behavior.

"Munchausen's" and "Malingering" examine factitious disorder fabrication and medical system abuse, analyzing how women's legitimate health concerns are often dismissed as attention-seeking while actual manipulation goes undetected. These episodes demonstrate how medical misogyny creates both under-treatment and exploitation opportunities.

"Trapped and Helpless" explores traumatic separation and psychological resilience in uncontrollable situations, recognizing how women disproportionately experience entrapment in abusive relationships, economic dependence, and caregiving obligations. "Taken Away" addresses sudden loss in intimate relationships and psychological trauma, examining grief's gendered dimensions.

The podcast consistently connects clinical expertise to feminist analysis, demonstrating how traditional psychology often pathologizes normal responses to oppression while ignoring structural violence's psychological impacts. Their approach validates listeners' experiences while providing practical tools for healing within unjust systems.

Suitable for audiences interested in feminist psychology, emotional labor, and patriarchy critique, particularly communities interested in psychological trauma, social justice, and clinical experience intersection. The show's gentle, in-depth, and ethically caring style makes it an important platform for psychology and feminism dialogue, offering therapeutic insight without depoliticizing suffering.
