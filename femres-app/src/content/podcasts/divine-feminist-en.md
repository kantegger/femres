- "Grounding the Sacred": Exploring how soul and humanity collaborate, proposing that the "sacred" must be rooted in body and reality
- "Boundaries: Because You're Worth It": Boundaries as feminist practice, rejecting cultural norms of unlimited giving
- "Honouring Our Wildness": Using "death" as entry point to reconstruct life's cyclical nature and natural rhythms
- "Opening to the Possibility of Beauty": Critiquing outcome-oriented culture, advocating for "possibility" and "beauty" as life guides
- "Confronting the Challenges" conversation with Laura Bates: Focusing on gender violence, youth education, and institutional change

The show is suitable for audiences interested in spiritual feminism, psychological healing, and depatriarchalized lifestyles, especially communities interested in self-awareness, energy balance, and cultural criticism. With a gentle, profound, and philosophical style, it serves as an important platform for spiritual feminist expression.
