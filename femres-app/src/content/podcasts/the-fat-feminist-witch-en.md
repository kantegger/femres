"The Fat Feminist Witch" is a feminist spiritual podcast hosted by Paige, dedicated to reconstructing witchcraft and body politics from a fat woman's perspective. The show challenges both mainstream body positivity's commercialization and traditional witchcraft's thin, white aesthetics.

"Introductory Awkwardness!" establishes the intersection of witch practice and fat advocacy, refusing to separate spiritual practice from body liberation. Paige demonstrates how fatphobia and witch persecution share historical roots in controlling women's bodies and autonomy.

"Weed, Women & Witches" explores cannabis culture and magical fusion from feminist perspectives, reclaiming plant medicine from both criminalization and masculinist stoner culture. This episode connects herbal knowledge suppression to broader patterns of women's healing wisdom erasure.

"The Wiccan History Lesson" provides critical analysis of Wicca's modern history and mythology, exposing how contemporary paganism often reproduces patriarchal structures while claiming ancient feminist heritage. "Godless Heathens!" explores secular witchcraft and religious critique, offering spiritual practice models that reject hierarchical deity worship.

"Book Review of Shadows" analyzes feminist and magical texts, demonstrating how critical reading serves both intellectual development and magical practice. Paige's approach consistently centers marginalized bodies and experiences typically excluded from both feminist and pagan spaces.

The podcast creates crucial space for fat witches and feminists who reject respectability politics in both movements. Paige's unapologetic approach challenges listeners to examine their own biases while building inclusive spiritual feminist community.

Suitable for audiences interested in bodily autonomy, religious patriarchy critique, and cultural critique, particularly communities interested in alternative spirituality, witchcraft history, and feminist magic. The show's frank, critical, and personally colored style makes it an important voice in feminist spiritual expression, proving radical body acceptance and spiritual practice are inseparable feminist acts.
