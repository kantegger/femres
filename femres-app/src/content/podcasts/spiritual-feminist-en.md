"The Spiritual Feminist" is a podcast interweaving feminism with spirituality, emphasizing "inner revolution" and self-repair as pathways to collective liberation. Leneth Witte's approach demonstrates how personal spiritual practice can be deeply political, challenging systems that disconnect women from their intuitive wisdom.

"Slow Living vs. Feminism" explores whether slow living conflicts with feminism, reflecting on tensions between "Boss Bitch" productivity culture and "Moss Bitch" earth-centered existence. This episode challenges capitalist feminism's emphasis on constant achievement, proposing alternative models of feminist success rooted in presence and sustainability.

"Spring Equinox & the In Between" examines spiritual symbolism of seasonal transitions and their intersection with women's bodily rhythms, reclaiming cyclical time from linear productivity demands. "Grief and Gratitude" navigates emotional journeys of mourning and appreciation, exploring grief as love's extension rather than pathology to overcome.

"Living Intuitively" addresses practices and challenges of intuitive living, emphasizing trust and flow over rigid planning. This approach particularly resonates with women socialized to doubt their inner knowing in favor of external validation. "Presence: My Word of 2025" offers annual reflection and intention setting with "presence" as core value, demonstrating how spiritual practice can ground political resistance.

The podcast creates space for women exhausted by performative activism and productivity-focused feminism, offering alternative models rooted in healing, intuition, and embodied wisdom. Leneth's gentle approach validates spiritual seeking as feminist practice rather than escapism.

Suitable for audiences interested in spiritual feminism, emotional labor, and bodily autonomy, particularly communities interested in slow living, trauma repair, and women's growth issues. The show's intimate, healing, and philosophical style makes it an important platform for spiritual feminist expression, demonstrating how inner work serves collective liberation.
