"Not Your Average Feminist" is a podcast that approaches feminist discourse from a conservative perspective, critiquing mainstream progressive feminist policy positions and cultural discourse. The show represents an alternative feminist voice that challenges dominant narratives within contemporary feminist movements.

Their Supreme Court hearing analysis compares treatment of Ketanji Brown Jackson versus Amy Coney Barrett, arguing for double standards in media coverage and confirmation processes. International Women's Day discussions address contradictions in gender social construction, particularly regarding transgender women's participation in women's sports, reflecting ongoing debates within feminist communities about gender identity and women's rights.

Equal Pay Day receives treatment through free market logic debates, questioning whether wage gaps primarily result from discrimination or other market factors. Their commentary on the "Don't Say Gay" bill and media events like Will Smith's slapping incident demonstrates their approach to cultural criticism from conservative feminist perspectives.

The hosts' personal newsletter "The Slip" features political satire and cultural criticism covering topics like Biden family corruption and conspiracy culture, providing additional context for their political positioning. Their approach consistently emphasizes individual responsibility over structural analysis, representing market feminism perspectives.

The podcast demonstrates internal diversity within feminist discourse, showing how feminist identity can encompass various political positions and policy preferences. While controversial within many feminist communities, their perspective represents real voices within women's political participation.

Suitable for audiences interested in liberal feminism, political participation, and media representation critique, particularly communities interested in diverse feminist positions and cultural conflicts. The show's satirical, outspoken style represents alternative feminist voices, demonstrating the complexity and internal debates within contemporary feminism rather than presenting feminism as monolithic movement.
