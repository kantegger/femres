"Gender Trouble" is a groundbreaking work published by American philosopher Judith Butler in 1990. This masterpiece, with its subversive theoretical insights, fundamentally transformed people's understanding of gender and opened a new chapter in postmodern feminist theory. The theoretical courage and philosophical depth that Butler demonstrates in this work has made it one of the most influential gender theory texts of the late 20th century.

Butler's core contribution is the introduction of the revolutionary theory of gender performativity, which completely overturned traditional concepts of gender. Within her theoretical framework, gender is not a fixed identity marker, nor a biological given fact, but rather something gradually constructed through daily repetitive behaviors and social performances. She encapsulates this viewpoint with a concise yet powerful expression: gender is something we "do," not something we naturally "are." This understanding liberates gender from essentialist constraints, revealing gender as a dynamic process of social construction.

More importantly, Butler offers profound critique of traditional binary gender oppositions. She points out that this seemingly natural binary classification is actually a framework imposed by social culture, which not only simplifies the complexity and diversity of human gender expression but, more critically, limits individuals' possibilities for exploring and expressing their own gender identity. By deconstructing this binary system, Butler opened new theoretical space for understanding gender fluidity and multiplicity.

In analyzing how society maintains this binary gender system, Butler introduces the concept of the "heterosexual matrix." She profoundly analyzes how compulsory heterosexuality shapes and maintains the binary gender system through various subtle yet powerful mechanisms, while marginalizing gender identities and sexual orientations that don't conform to this framework. This analysis not only reveals the political nature of gender systems but also provides important theoretical tools for understanding various forms of gender and sexuality oppression.

"Gender Trouble's" contribution to feminist theory is multifaceted and far-reaching. It pioneered queer theory, laying solid philosophical foundations for this emerging theoretical field. At the same time, it provided crucial theoretical resources for transgender studies, granting transgender experiences academic legitimacy and theoretical support. More broadly, this work greatly expanded feminism's understanding of gender concepts, liberating them from the limitations of biological determinism.

However, Butler's theoretical contributions extend beyond this. She also offers profound questioning of political strategies based on fixed identity categories. She argues that the identity categories we typically use to organize political action—such as "women," "men," etc.—are themselves products of power discourse, and therefore political strategies relying on these categories might inadvertently reinforce the power structures they attempt to challenge. This critique provides important theoretical perspective for rethinking identity politics.

From the perspective of academic influence, "Gender Trouble" is recognized as one of the most important gender theory works of the 20th century. It has had profound impact across multiple disciplinary fields including gender studies, philosophy, sociology, and literary criticism, sparking extensive and in-depth discussions about gender, identity, and politics. More importantly, it became a foundational text for queer theory and transgender studies, providing crucial theoretical foundations for the development of these emerging fields.

On a practical level, "Gender Trouble" holds immeasurable value for understanding contemporary gender issues. It provides powerful theoretical support for LGBTQ+ rights movements, helping people better understand the fluidity and diversity of gender identity. At the same time, it also provides important intellectual weapons for challenging traditional gender norms and social expectations, encouraging people to rethink and redefine their own gender identity. In an era of increasing recognition of gender complexity, Butler's theoretical insights appear more precious and timely than ever.
