*The Feminine Mystique* is a groundbreaking work by American feminist thinker Betty Friedan, published in 1963. This book, with its profound social insight and revolutionary perspective, deeply analyzed the myth of "femininity" in 1950s American society, sharply exposing how societal stereotypes about women's roles systematically limited women's development and self-realization. This work is not only a foundational text of the modern feminist movement but is also acclaimed as the spark that ignited the second wave of feminism, with far-reaching influence that continues to shape our understanding of gender roles and women's status today.

Friedan introduced an extraordinarily insightful concept in her book—"the problem that has no name"—using this symbolically rich phrase to precisely describe the deep sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction commonly experienced by American middle-class housewives of the time. These women appeared to possess everything society deemed a perfect life—comfortable suburban homes, caring husbands, healthy children, and all modern conveniences—yet they felt an inexplicable profound unhappiness and internal emptiness. This pain was so pervasive yet so hidden that society at the time couldn't name it, much less provide effective solutions. Friedan keenly identified this collective psychological predicament and courageously named it, thereby breaking the silence and taboo surrounding this issue.

In her penetrating critique of the feminine mystique, Friedan revealed how society had carefully constructed an ideological system about the "ideal woman." This mythological system positioned women as naturally suited for family-centered lifestyles, emphasizing that women should derive their identity and life's worth entirely through their husbands and children, while suggesting that women should willingly abandon personal career pursuits and aspirations for self-realization. This ideology was reinforced and disseminated through various social institutions and cultural channels—from educational systems to mass media, from psychological theories to consumer culture—all continuously repeating and consolidating this narrative about women's "essence." Friedan profoundly pointed out that this seemingly natural gender division was actually a product of social construction, which not only limited women's developmental potential but fundamentally distorted understanding of human nature and individual worth.

To address this predicament, Friedan strongly emphasized the fundamental importance of education and career for women's development. She believed women must receive comprehensive higher education, not merely to acquire knowledge and skills, but more importantly to cultivate independent thinking and critical analysis abilities. She advocated that women should actively pursue meaningful careers, developing their talents and creativity through work to realize personal value and social contribution. Most crucially, she called for women to establish independent identity beyond family roles, developing complete personalities and autonomous life goals. This viewpoint was extremely radical at the time, as it directly challenged fundamental societal assumptions about women's roles.

The historical impact of *The Feminine Mystique* has been profound and lasting. The book's publication marked a major turning point in American social gender perceptions, with influence extending far beyond academic and intellectual circles to penetrate the daily lives and consciousness awakening of ordinary women.

As an important catalyst for the second wave feminist movement, *The Feminine Mystique* played an irreplaceable enlightening role. It inspired countless women to reconsider their life choices and question seemingly natural social expectations and role arrangements. Many women who read this book began to realize that the confusion and dissatisfaction they felt were not personal problems but products of the entire social structure. This shift in recognition had revolutionary significance because it politicized personal pain, thereby laying the foundation for collective action. Friedan's analysis promoted the historic wave of women entering the workforce, as more and more women began seeking educational opportunities and career development, challenging traditional gender division models. More importantly, this book laid crucial social groundwork for subsequent gender equality legislation, changing public perceptions of gender roles and creating favorable public opinion for legal and policy reforms.

On the level of social transformation, the publication of *The Feminine Mystique* brought about profound and widespread changes. Following the book's release, increasingly more women returned to campuses and workplaces, pursuing personal education and career development. This trend not only changed labor market structures but also promoted educational system reforms and improvements. The diversification of family structures became another important social change, as traditional nuclear family models were no longer the only option, with various new family forms beginning to emerge and gain acceptance. The most profound change was the fundamental transformation of gender role concepts, as society began reconsidering the roles of men and women in family, work, and society, laying the ideological foundation for subsequent gender equality endeavors.

Despite dramatic changes in temporal context, *The Feminine Mystique* remains highly relevant and deeply inspiring in contemporary society. Many questions Friedan raised over half a century ago still exist in today's society, even continuing to trouble modern women in new forms.

Modern women still face enormous challenges in balancing work and family—a problem that has become even more complex than in Friedan's era. Today's women must not only pursue career development in the workplace but also bear important family caregiving responsibilities, creating a double burden that leaves many women physically and mentally exhausted. Social expectations of the "perfect woman" have not disappeared but have become more complex and demanding. Modern women are expected to be both successful career women and perfect mothers and wives, placing enormous psychological pressure on women. Identity confusion has become even more prominent in contemporary times, as modern women must find balance among multiple roles, determining how to find themselves among career achievements, family responsibilities, and personal development remains an important challenge many women face.

For Asian women, *The Feminine Mystique* provides particularly important illuminating significance. The conflict between traditional family concepts and modern women's pursuits appears especially prominent in Asian cultural contexts, as many Asian women must find balance between traditional filial piety and family responsibilities versus personal career pursuits and autonomous development. Glass ceiling phenomena in the workplace remain widespread in Asian societies, with women still facing various visible and invisible obstacles in career development. Social perceptions of return on investment in women's education still harbor bias, as many society members continue believing that educational investment in women will ultimately not receive full returns due to family responsibilities, limiting women's equal access to educational opportunities.

However, as a product of a specific historical period, *The Feminine Mystique* also faces criticism and reflection from academia and social activists. These critiques help us understand more comprehensively the value and limitations of this work.

Scholars have pointed out several important limitations in this book. First, Friedan's analysis primarily focused on the experiences and predicaments of white middle-class women, making this perspective's limitations difficult to fully explain and encompass the experiences of women from other social groups. Insufficient attention to the situations of women of color and working-class women represents another important point of criticism, as these women often face multiple oppressions of race, class, and gender, with their experiences and needs differing significantly from white middle-class women. Additionally, some critics argue that Friedan somewhat devalued domestic labor, suggesting her emphasis on career pursuit might overlook the important social functions and intrinsic value of family caregiving work.

Despite these limitations, Friedan's ideas received important expansion and correction in subsequent feminist theoretical developments. The development of intersectionality theory provided a more comprehensive framework for understanding the complexity of women's experiences, emphasizing the interaction of multiple identity dimensions such as gender, race, and class, compensating for deficiencies in Friedan's analysis. Attention to diverse women's experiences became an important characteristic of subsequent feminist theory, as scholars began paying more attention to the unique experiences and needs of women from different backgrounds. The revaluation of domestic labor was also an important theoretical development, as later feminist scholars began deeply analyzing the economic value and social significance of care work, advocating for appropriate recognition and support for this long-overlooked form of labor.

*The Feminine Mystique*, as a classic text of feminist theory, suits various reader groups from different backgrounds, with each group able to gain different levels of inspiration and benefit.

For feminist theory researchers, this book provides important historical materials and theoretical foundations for understanding the origins and development of the second wave feminist movement. Students of sociology and psychology can learn how to apply interdisciplinary methods to analyze complex social phenomena, particularly how gender roles and social expectations influence individual psychological states and behavioral patterns. General readers concerned with gender equality issues can gain deeper understanding of the historical roots and social mechanisms of gender inequality through this book, enabling better participation in social actions promoting gender equality. For modern women facing life choice confusion, this book provides important theoretical support and emotional resonance, helping them understand that their confusion and struggles have deeper social roots.

To better understand and appreciate this book, readers need to understand the historical background of 1950s American society, including the economic prosperity, suburbanization development, nuclear family ideals, and social atmosphere of the Cold War era, as this background knowledge helps readers understand the social context of Friedan's analysis. Simultaneously, readers should employ critical thinking, combining contemporary perspectives to rationally analyze Friedan's viewpoints, both appreciating her pioneering contributions and recognizing limitations in her analysis. Personal reflection is an important component of reading this book, as readers should consider the connections between the book's viewpoints and their own experiences, helping deepen understanding and application of the theory. Additionally, for more comprehensive understanding, readers are encouraged to read this book alongside other feminist classics, such as Simone de Beauvoir's *The Second Sex* and bell hooks' works, to gain a more diverse and complete feminist theoretical perspective.

Friedan left many profound insights in *The Feminine Mystique* that continue to shine today, representing the essence of her deep understanding of women's status and social gender relations. She said: "We must begin to see women as complete human beings, not merely as mothers, wives, or sexual objects." This statement directly challenged traditional society's practice of reducing women to specific roles, emphasizing women's complete personalities and diverse values as independent individuals. She further pointed out: "The problem is that women have been taught to define themselves through others, rather than through their own actions and achievements." This observation revealed the core problem in gender socialization processes—that women are encouraged to seek self-worth from external relationships rather than building confidence and identity from internal capabilities and personal achievements. Most importantly, she insisted: "Every woman has the right to develop her talents and realize her potential." This statement embodied her firm belief in basic human rights and individual development, emphasizing that everyone, regardless of gender, should have equal opportunities to exercise their talents and pursue personal growth.

*The Feminine Mystique* is not merely a product of a specific era but an eternal mirror that allows us to continuously examine society's expectations and limitations on women. The book's value transcends its historical context, becoming an important text for understanding gender relations and social change. Through her keen observations and courageous analysis, Friedan provided us with important tools for recognizing and critiquing gender inequality, her ideas inspiring generation after generation of women and men to reconsider traditional gender roles and social expectations.

Although times continue changing and social environments have undergone tremendous transformation, striving for true gender equality remains an ongoing and lengthy process. While contemporary society has made important progress at legal and institutional levels, deep-seated gender biases and structural inequalities persist, making Friedan's analysis still highly relevant today. Her work reminds us that gender equality is not merely a matter of legal provisions but of conceptual transformation and sociocultural change.

This book's most important contribution lies in reminding us that women's value should not be defined solely by their gender roles but should receive respect and developmental opportunities as complete individuals. Every woman has the right to pursue her dreams, develop her talents, and establish her identity, rather than being restricted within traditional gender expectations. In today's increasingly diverse and open world, Friedan's voice continues to possess powerful inspirational force, continuing to encourage people to strive for building a more equal, just, and inclusive society.
